# Outbreak
**IN PROGRESS**
This page is in progress, more information will be posted soon.

## What is Outbreak?
Outbreak is a top-down 2D multiplayer shooter.


## Why make it a public project?
Outbreak was originally meant to be made by two people, but after one left, it didn't seem possible to create the entire project with just one person that has limited artistic talent and time. Because of this, we have decided to make Outbreak a community project.

## Will the code be made open source?
We really do want to make Outbreak a completely open source project, however there are a couple reasons holding us back from doing this:

1. It would be easy to just compile the project and play for free. If/when the project is added to Steam, the price will not be much, but our hope is to be able to cover the costs of creating the game with the purchases made on Steam.
2. By making the source code 100% public, it would be very easy for someone to create a clone/copy the entire project and publish it as their own (or even try selling it for profit)
And yes, we do realize that if someone is dedicated enough, they could buy a copy of the game and extract the source code from that. This does seem like a reason to make the project open source, but for the two reasons above, this won't be happening yet (once it goes further in development, it will most likely become completely open source)

Because of the somewhat open source/contribution friendly nature of this project, it is not going to be easy to make money for the game (especially once it goes open source, where you could most likely just download the source code and run it for free), any donations would be *greatly* appreciated.
